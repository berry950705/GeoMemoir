# GeoMemoir

This is a project for sharing traveling experiences and photos. It was built with Flask as the frontend and Django as the backend. Scrapy was also utilized to extract data.
The website is being hosted on AWS and Route 53 was set up to route traffic for the domain. Nginx, as a reverse proxy, passes requests to either frontend (port 5000) or backend (port 8000).
